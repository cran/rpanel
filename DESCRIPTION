Description: A set of functions to build simple 
        GUI controls for R functions.  These are built on the 'tcltk' package. 
        Uses could include changing a parameter on a graph by animating it 
        with a slider or a "doublebutton", up to more sophisticated control 
        panels.
        Some functions for specific graphical tasks, referred to as 'cartoons',
        are provided.
