\title{Interactive display of logistic regression with a single covariate}

\description{
  The function \code{rp.logistic} plots a binary or binomial response variable 
  against a single covariates and creates a panel which controls the position of 
  a logistic curve and allows a logistic regression to be fitted to the data and 
  displayed on the plot.
  }

\usage{
   rp.logistic(x, y, xlab = NA, ylab = NA, panel.plot = TRUE, panel = TRUE,
               hscale = NA, vscale = hscale, alpha = 0, beta = 0, 
               display = c("jitter" = FALSE, "regression line" = FALSE,
               "fitted model" = FALSE))
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of covariate values.}
\item{y}{a vector of response values with two levels, or a two-column matrix whose first column is the number of `successes' and the second column is the number of `failures' at each covariate value.}
\item{xlab}{a character variable used for the covariate axis label.}
\item{ylab}{a character variable used for the response axis label.}
\item{panel.plot}{a logical variable which determines whether the plot is placed inside the control panel.}
\item{panel}{a logical variable which determines whether an interactive panel is created.}
\item{hscale, vscale}{horizontal and vertical scaling factors for the size of the plots.  It can be useful to adjust these for projection on a screen, for example.  The default values are 1 on Unix platforms and 1.4 on Windows platforms.}
\item{alpha}{the initial value of the intercept parameter.}
\item{beta}{the initial value of the slope parameter.}
\item{display}{the initial settings of the checkboxes which control whether the data are `jittered' for visual effect and whether the movable and fitted regression lines are displayed.}
}

\details{
The control panel allows a logistic regression line to be drawn on the plot and the intercept and slope of the linear predictor altered interactively.  The fitted logistic regression can also be displayed.
  
If \code{y} is a vector of responses with two values, these are treated as a factor which is then converted to the (0,1) scale by \code{as.numeric}.
  
The values of the response variable can be `jittered'.
