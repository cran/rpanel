\title{Intervals between the failure of air-conditioning equipment in aircraft}

\description{
These data, reported by Proschan (1963, Technometrics 5, 375-383), refer to
the intervals, in service-hours, between failures of the air-conditioning
equipment in a Boeing 720 aircraft.  (Proschan reports data on 10 different
aircraft.  The data from only one of the aircraft is used here.  
Cox and Snell (1981, Applied Statistics: principles and examples,
Chapman and Hall, London) discuss the analysis of the data on all 10 aircraft.)

The dataset consists of a single vector of data.  They are used in the \code{\link{rp.likelihood}} example script.
