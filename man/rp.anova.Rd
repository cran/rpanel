\description{
  This function plots response data, separated by one or two factors.  
  It also creates a panel which controls the models which can be fitted to the
  data and displayed on the plot.  A comparison model can also be selected
  and the results of an F-test are displayed graphically.
}

\usage{
rp.anova(y, x, z, model = NA, model0 = NA, ylab = NA, xlab = NA, zlab = NA, title = NULL,
         lines = TRUE, panel = TRUE, panel.plot = TRUE, hscale = 1.3,
         vscale = hscale / 1.3)
}

\arguments{
\item{y}{a vector of response values.}
\item{x}{a factor which splits \code{y} into different groups.}
\item{z}{an optional second factor which splits \code{y} into a second set of groups.}
\item{model, model0}{logical vectors of length 2 or 4, for one or two factors respectively,
defining the initial and comparison models to be fitted.  For one factor, the two values
determine whether each of the terms for the intercept and \code{x} appear.  For two factors,
the four values determine whether each of the four terms intercept, \code{x}, \code{z} and
\code{x:z} appear.}
\item{ylab}{a character name used for the response variable.}
\item{xlab}{a character name used for the first factor.}
\item{zlab}{a character variable used for the response axis label.}
\item{title}{a character variable supplying a title.  (This is used only in the case where \code{panel} is \code{FALSE}.)}
\item{lines}{a logical variable which determines whether lines are drawn to connect the
estimated means for each group.  This can be helpful in highlighting the relative positions of
the means across the groups.}
\item{panel}{a logical variable which determines whether a panel is created to allow
	interactive control of the fitted models.}
\item{panel.plot}{a logical parameter which determines whether the plot is placed inside the 
	panel (TRUE) or the standard graphics window (FALSE).  If the plot is to be placed inside
	the panel then the \code{tkrplot} library is required.}
\item{hscale, vscale}{scaling parameters for the size of the plot when \code{panel.plot} is
	set to \code{TRUE}.}
}

\details{
The data are displayed as points superimposed on a density strip created by the 
\pkg{denstrip} package.  Selected models are displayed through the fitted values for each
group.  When a valid comparison model is selected, its fitted values are displayed along
with a shaded regions expressing the contribution of the differences between the two sets
of fitted values to the F-statistic.  The F-test is displayed in graphical form with a density
strip to represent the F-distribution and a point to indicate the observed value of the
F-statistic.
  
Static plots, for printing or other purposes can be created by setting
the panel argument to FALSE and specifying the models of interest.
